# The LLDB Debugger

The LLDB Debugger (LLDB) is an open-source software debugger that is a next generation, high-performance. It features a REPL, along with C++ and Python plugins.

A debugger allows you to pause a program at a specific moment of its execution, inspect the values of variables, execute custom instructions, and then manipulate the advancement of the program as you see fit. 

LLDB is the default debugger in Xcode on Mac OS X and supports debugging C, Objective-C and C++ on the desktop and iOS devices and simulator.

## <a name="lldb-command"> The LLDB command

The LLDB commands are all of the form:

```
<noun> <verb> [-options [option-value]] [argument [argument...]]
```

You can see the debugger commands with the help command.

```
(lldb) help
Debugger commands:
apropos           -- List debugger commands related to a word or subject.
breakpoint        -- Commands for operating on breakpoints (see 'help b' for
shorthand.)
bugreport         -- Commands for creating domain-specific bug reports.
command           -- Commands for managing custom LLDB commands.
disassemble       -- Disassemble specified instructions in the current
target.  Defaults to the current function for the
current thread and stack frame.
expression        -- Evaluate an expression on the current thread.  Displays
any returned value with LLDB's default formatting.
frame             -- Commands for selecting and examing the current thread's
stack frames.
gdb-remote        -- Connect to a process via remote GDB server.  If no host
is specifed, localhost is assumed.

...
```

Also, can see more detailed commands by adding commands and subcommand options (`help <command> <subcommand>`).

```
(lldb) help breakpoint
Commands for operating on breakpoints (see 'help b' for shorthand.)

Syntax: breakpoint <subcommand> [<command-options>]

The following subcommands are supported:

clear   -- Delete or disable breakpoints matching the specified source
file and line.
command -- Commands for adding, removing and listing LLDB commands
executed when a breakpoint is hit.
delete  -- Delete the specified breakpoint(s).  If no breakpoints are
specified, delete them all.
disable -- Disable the specified breakpoint(s) without deleting them.  If
none are specified, disable all breakpoints.
enable  -- Enable the specified disabled breakpoint(s). If no breakpoints
are specified, enable all of them.

...
```
